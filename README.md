# Geometry

## Overview

This is a library containing structs and methods that are useful in geometry. This project is written in Go.

## Structs and methods

The structs and their corresponding methods contained in this library are:

- Circle
  - Area
  - Circumference
  - Diameter
- Point
- Rectangle
  - Area
  - Length
  - Perimeter
  - Width

## How to initialize an instance of a struct using this library

Call the `Make` functions found in each struct's file to create new instances of the struct.

E.g. the `MakeRectangle` function located in `rectangle.go` returns a new rectangle.

## Use the geometry library

To import the library into a Go project: run `go get github.com/magikitty/geometry` in the terminal. Then add the library path `github.com/magikitty/geometry` to the `import` list in your Go project.

To clone the project: run `git clone https://github.com/magikitty/geometry.git` in the directory you want.
